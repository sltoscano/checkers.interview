Problem: Write a Checkers subset 

 

Write a program that can play a legal game of Checkers Lite. The computer makes 

legal moves (random legal moves are acceptable for this checkers "AI").

The human player is not allowed to make illegal moves.

 

Checkers Lite is the same as American Checkers (also known as 

English draughts) except there is no promotion to king by moving a piece to the last 

rank (therefore stalemate is possible). Pieces move along diagonals, and jumps must 

be taken, and the board is 8 x 8. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers if you 

need a refresher on the rules.

 

Your program should show the game board after each move. 

 

If there are no legal moves, or one side is eliminated, the game is over. 

  

Suggested board output format as ASCII - use . for empty square, X for black, O for white. The 

initial board layout might look like this 

  

. X . X . X . X 

X . X . X . X . 

. X . X . X . X 

. . . . . . . . 

. . . . . . . . 

O . O . O . O . 

. O . O . O . O 

O . O . O . O . 

  

This should take you between 1 and 4 hours to complete. Please present a working 

program along with the amount of time you spent on the program. You can do this

as a command-line program if you like (that's completely acceptable), or you can do

it as a GUI program, but a working program in 4 hours or less is your mandate.
